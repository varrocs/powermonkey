## Powermonkey

An example project for a linux workshop in hackerspace-szeged.

The purpose of this code is to be the firmware of a device that receives parameters through i2c and cuts off the power after it received a command. After a while it switches back the power.

I used the i2c library from https://github.com/eriksl/usitwislave.git
